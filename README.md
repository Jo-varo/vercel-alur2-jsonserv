# JSON-Server CRUD on Vercel

Project based on
- [*Create RESTful API with JSON Server and deploy it to Vercel*](https://ivo-culic.medium.com/create-restful-api-with-json-server-and-deploy-it-to-vercel-d56061c1157a) by Ivo Culic - [*Repo*](https://github.com/ifkas/restful-api-vercel)
- [*Deploy JSON Server to Vercel*](https://github.com/kitloong/json-server-vercel/tree/main) by KitLoong


This project mixes the code from both projects and it was made on ES Modules.

> Previously, I tried to do this project with json-server v.1.0.0-alpha.23 and I couldn't make it run on vercel, so don't change the version of json-server


## How to use
1. Clone the repo, download or copy the code.
2. Update or use the default "**db.json**" file.
3. Upload the project to Github.
4. Sign Up or login into [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
5. From the Vercel dashboard, click "**+ New Project**" then "**Import**" your repository.
5. In the "**Configure Project**" screen, leave everything default and click "**Deploy**".
6. Wait until deployment is done, and your own JSON server is ready to serve!
